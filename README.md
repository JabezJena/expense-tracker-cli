# 💰 Expense Tracker CLI

A simple and lightweight command-line Expense Tracker written in Python. This tool helps you keep track of your spending by letting you add items with prices, list them, and calculate your total expenses.

## ✨ Features

- Add items with a name and price
- View all items entered
- Calculate and display total expenses
- Menu-driven command-line interface

## 🖥️ Example Usage


Welcome to our Expense tracker !

1.Add Item
2.Show Items
3.Calculate the total expense
4.Quit


Example:
Enter the name of the product : Coffee
Enter the price of the product: 5
Name : Coffee price : 5

🧠 How It Works
Products are stored as dictionaries in a list.

Each dictionary contains a single key-value pair (name: price).

The total is calculated by summing all stored prices.
